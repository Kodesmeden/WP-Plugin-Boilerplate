# WP-Plugin-Boilerplate

Like so many others... This WordPress plugin boilerplate is my own take of what a good boilerplate should look like. It's simple and yet powerful, and the base of all my own custom WordPress plugins.

Functionality will be added and updated from time to time. But for now - Enjoy!
